The fledgling is probably a male (small size). It is still in the same area. Calling incessantly but seemingly doing alright. It is not capable of flying but can hop to 1m height. 

18:37 Female adult delivered food in the nest on the spruce. Saw 2 juveniles come down from canopy into the nest. Larger, probably females.

19:00 ended observation. No food was delivered to the fledgling on the ground.

Recorded with a directional microphone. 100 Hz low-cut filter. Location obscured to protect the nest. Urban area, human voices audible.

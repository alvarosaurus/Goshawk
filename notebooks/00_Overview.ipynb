    "## Introduction\n",
    "The characteristic habitats of the northern goshawk (_Accipiter gentilis_) are extended conifer\n",
    "or deciduous forests with a dense canopy. Due to the bird’s secretive nature, well-hidden\n",
    "nests and extended foraging area, it often goes undetected during surveys, except by its\n",
    "vocalisations ([Watson et al., 1999]. Identifying the vocalisations of the goshawk is therefore a good method for detecting their presence [Roberson et al., 2001]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Xeno-Canto](http://xeno-canto.org) website is a searchable repository for crowdsourced, good quality, freely distributed recordings of bird vocalisations. Recordings downloaded from Xeno-Canto were used to identify different types of calls. The categories were obtained by applying unsupervised machine learning computer techniques. Finally, a bayesian analysis was used to find correlations between call categories and the stages of the annual breeding cycle, thus providing a clue to the type of interaction implied by the call."
